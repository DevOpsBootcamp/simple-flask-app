Now What?
---------

There are a few options. If you would like to investigate Python and Flask
further take a look at the [Flask Quickstart
Guide](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/)

1. Skim the quickstart.
2. Add another page (``localhost:$MYPORT/mypage`` for example).
3. Display a randomly chosen message from a list each time the user loads the
   page.
4. Link to the new page from your original page.

Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html)
